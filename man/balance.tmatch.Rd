\usage{
balance.tmatch(object, vars, data)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{an object of class \code{tmatch} -- results from a call to \code{telescope_match}}

\item{vars}{a formula object containing either the treatment or the mediator as the dependent variable (which denotes whether first-stage or
second-stage balance diagnostics are returned) and the covariates for which balance diagnostics are requested as the independent variables. Each covariate
or function of covariates (e.g. higher-order polynomials or interactions) should be separated by a +.}

\item{data}{the data frame used in the call to \code{telescope_match}}
}
\value{
Returns a data frame with the following columns.
\itemize{
\item variable: Name of covariate
\item Before_M0/Before_A0: Pre-matching average of the covariate in the mediator == 0 (if first stage balance) or 
treatment == 0 (if second stage balance) condition
\item Before_M1/Before_A1: Pre-matching average of the covariate in the mediator == 1 (if first stage balance) or 
treatment == 1 (if second stage balance) condition
\item After_M0/After_A0: Post-matching average of the covariate in the mediator == 0 (if first stage balance) or 
treatment == 0 (if second stage balance) condition
\item After_M1/After_A1: Post-matching average of the covariate in the mediator == 1 (if first stage balance) or 
treatment == 1 (if second stage balance) condition
\item SD: standard deviation of the outcome (pre-Matching)
\item Before_Diff: Pre-matching covariate difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or treatment arms
(if second stage balance).
\item Before_Std_Diff: Pre-matching standardized covariate difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or
treatment arms (if second stage balance), Equal to Before_Diff/SD.
\item After_Diff: Post--matching covariate difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or treatment arms
(if second stage balance).
\item After_Std_Diff: Post-matching standardized covariate difference between mediator arms (if first stage balance) or
treatment arms (if second stage balance), Equal to Before_Diff/SD.
